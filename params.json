{"name":"MultiMiner","tagline":"Your Coins. Your Pools. Your way.","body":"__MultiMiner__ is a graphical application for crypto-coin mining on Windows, OS X and Linux. MultiMiner simplifies switching individual devices (GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs) between crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.\r\n\r\nMultiMiner uses the underlying mining engine ([bfgminer][2]) to detect available mining devices and then presents a user interface for selecting the coins you'd like to mine.\r\n\r\n![Main Screen](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Main%20Screen.png \"Main Screen\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner also offers several views, allowing you to display as much or as little information as you like.\r\n\r\n![Brief View](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Brief%20View.png \"Brief View\")\r\n\r\nFor new users, MultiMiner includes a Getting Started wizard that walks you through selecting an engine, a coin, a pool, and configuring [MobileMiner][14].\r\n\r\n![Getting Started](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Getting%20Started.png \"Getting Started\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner will automatically download and install the latest version of [bfgminer][2], making it simple for the new user to get started.\r\n\r\n![Downloading and Installing Cgminer](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Downloading%20and%20Installing%20Bfgminer.png \"Downloading and Installing Cgminer\")\r\n\r\nYou can then use the Configure Coins dialog to setup each coin that you would like to mine along with their pools, including support for load balancing.\r\n\r\n![Configure Coins](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Configure%20Coins.png \"Configure Coins\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner supports automatically mining the most profitable coins based on a set of configurable strategies. Profitability information is updated regularly from [CoinChoose.com][9].\r\n\r\n![Configure Strategies](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Configure%20Strategies.png \"Configure Strategies\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner also supports features such as relaunching crashed miners, starting with Windows, minimizing to the notification area, and mining on startup.\r\n\r\n![Settings](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Settings.png \"Settings\")\r\n\r\nYou can also use the interface provided by MultiMiner to adjust advanced settings such as API white-listing, disabling GPU mining, and automatically adjusting mining intensity based on the computer's idle time.\r\n\r\n![Advanced Miner Settings](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Advanced%20Miner%20Settings.png \"Advanced Miner Settings\")\r\n\r\nFinally, MultiMiner supports [MobileMiner][14], an open API with mobile apps for remotely monitoring and controlling your rigs.\r\n\r\n![MobileMiner](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/MobileMiner.png \"MobileMiner\")\r\n\r\n![MobileMiner - Android](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/MobileMiner%20-%20Android.png \"MobileMiner - Android\")\r\n\r\n![MobileMiner - Windows Phone](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/MobileMiner%20-%20Windows%20Phone.png \"MobileMiner - Windows Phone\")\r\n\r\nBy entering your MobileMiner email address and application key in the Configure Settings dialog, you will be able to remotely monitor and control your rigs _without having to open any firewalls or forward any ports_.\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n----------------\r\nYou can download installers and zip files for Windows, OS X, Linux and Mono on the [GitHub Releases page][12].\r\n\r\nDrivers\r\n-------\r\nDepending on your OS and the mining devices you plan on using you will need one or more of the following drivers / kernel extensions installed:\r\n\r\n* [Block Erupter][20]\r\n* [Blue / Red Fury][21]\r\n* [BFL / Bitforce][22]\r\n* [HashBuster Micro][23]\r\n* [AMD GPU][24]\r\n\r\nWindows Installation\r\n--------------------\r\n1. Download and run the installer (.exe) file at the above link and follow instructions\r\n\r\nThe installer runs without needing admin rights and does not install to Program Files so as not to be intrusive. However, if you prefer you can use the zip file:\r\n\r\n1. Download and extract the .zip file at the [GitHub Releases page][12]\r\n2. Launch MultiMiner.Win.exe to get started\r\n\r\nOS X Installation\r\n-----------------\r\n1. Install Xquartz available [here][7]\r\n2. Install the latest version of [Mono][8]\r\n3. Download and extract the __.app__.zip file at the [GitHub Releases page][12]\r\n4. Launch MultiMiner.app to get started\r\n\r\nMultiMiner will automatically download redistributable binaries of bfgminer from the [xgminer-osx][13] project.\r\n\r\n![Main Screen - OS X](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Main%20Screen%20-%20OS%20X.png \"Main Screen - OS X\")\r\n\r\nLinux Installation (Debian-Based)\r\n---------------------------------\r\n1. Install the latest version of [Mono][8]\r\n\r\n        sudo apt-get install mono-complete\r\n        \r\n2. Install your chosen mining engine\r\n\r\n        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:unit3/bfgminer\r\n        sudo apt-get update\r\n        sudo apt-get install bfgminer\r\n        \r\n3. Download and extract the .zip file at the [GitHub Releases page][12]\r\n4. Run MultiMiner.Win.exe using mono:\r\n\r\n        mono MultiMiner.Win.exe\r\n        \r\n![Main Screen - Linux](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Main%20Screen%20-%20Linux.png \"Main Screen - Linux\")\r\n        \r\nGeneric Mono Installation\r\n-------------------------------\r\n1. Download and extract the zip file at the [GitHub Releases page][12]\r\n2. Install bfgminer. For OS X, you can find packages and for doing so [here][5] and instructions for using them [here][6].\r\n3.

Run MultiMiner.Win.exe using mono:\r\n\r\n        mono MultiMiner.Win.exe\r\n        \r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\nThe official forum thread for MultiMiner can be found [here][15].\r\n        \r\nSource Code\r\n-----------\r\nThe source code is structured in such a way that it should be fairly easy to use and re-use for other projects:\r\n\r\n* __MultiMiner.Xgminer__ is an assembly for controlling the bfgminer executable - e.g. launching and enumerating devices\r\n* __MultiMiner.Xgminer.Api__ assists in communicating with the underlying miner via the RPC API\r\n* __MultiMiner.Coinchoose.Api__ assists in consuming the cypto-currency information available at [CoinChoose.com][9]\r\n* __MultiMiner.MobileMiner.Api__ facilitates communicating with the [MobileMiner][14] REST API\r\n* __MultiMiner.Engine__ is an assembly that can be used to interact with all functionality found in MultiMiner, but without a UI - useful for creating front-ends for other OS's\r\n* __MultiMiner.Win__ is the Windows Forms application\r\n\r\nSource Code Example\r\n-------------\r\nThis simple example shows how to use [MultiMiner.Xgminer.dll][16] and [MultiMiner.Xgminer.Api.dll][17] to install bfgminer, iterate through available mining devices, and launch the miner.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the bfgminer [RPC API][18] is used to output the miner hashrate for a minute before the mining process is stopped. You can try this code out yourself in the [MultiMiner.Api.Example][19] project.\r\n\r\n![MultiMiner.Api.Example](https://raw.github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/master/Screenshots/MultiMiner.Api.Example.png \"MultiMiner.Api.Example\")\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n//examples of using MultiMiner.Xgminer.dll and MultiMiner.Xgminer.Api.dll\r\n\r\n//download and install the latest version of bfgminer\r\nconst string executablePath = @\"D:\\bfgminer\\\";\r\nconst string executableName = \"bfgminer.exe\";\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Downloading and installing {0} from {1} to the directory {2}\",\r\n    executableName, Xgminer.Installer.GetMinerDownloadRoot(), executablePath);\r\n\r\n//download and install bfgminer from the official website\r\nXgminer.Installer.InstallMiner(executablePath);\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    //create an instance of Miner with the downloaded executable\r\n    MinerConfiguration minerConfiguration = new MinerConfiguration()\r\n    {\r\n        ExecutablePath = Path.Combine(executablePath, executableName)\r\n    };\r\n    Miner miner = new Miner(minerConfiguration);\r\n\r\n    //use it to iterate through devices\r\n    List<Device> deviceList = miner.ListDevices();\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Using {0} to list available mining devices\", executableName);\r\n\r\n    //output devices\r\n    foreach (Device device in deviceList)\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Device detected: {0}\\t{1}\\t{2}\", device.Kind, device.Driver, device.Name);\r\n\r\n    //start mining if there are devices\r\n    if (deviceList.Count > 0)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"{0} device(s) detected, mining Bitcoin on Bitminter using all devices\", deviceList.Count);\r\n\r\n        //setup a pool\r\n        MiningPool pool = new MiningPool()\r\n        {\r\n            Host = \"mint.bitminter.com\",\r\n            Port = 3333,\r\n            Username = \"nwoolls_deepcore\",\r\n            Password = \"deepcore\"\r\n        };\r\n        minerConfiguration.Pools.Add(pool);\r\n\r\n        //specify algorithm\r\n        minerConfiguration.Algorithm = CoinAlgorithm.SHA256;\r\n\r\n        //disable GPU mining\r\n        minerConfiguration.DisableGpu = true;\r\n\r\n        //specify device indexes to use\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < deviceList.Count; i++)\r\n            minerConfiguration.DeviceDescriptors.Add(deviceList[i]);\r\n\r\n        //enable RPC API\r\n        minerConfiguration.ApiListen = true;\r\n        minerConfiguration.ApiPort = 4028;\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Launching {0}\", executableName);\r\n\r\n        //start mining\r\n        miner = new Miner(minerConfiguration);\r\n        System.Diagnostics.Process minerProcess = miner.Launch();\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            //get an API context\r\n            Xgminer.Api.ApiContext apiContext = new Xgminer.Api.ApiContext(minerConfiguration.ApiPort);\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                //mine for one minute, monitoring hashrate via the API\r\n                for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)\r\n                {\r\n                    Thread.Sleep(1000 * 10); //sleep 10s\r\n\r\n                    //query the miner process via its RPC API for device information\r\n                    List<Xgminer.Api.Responses.DeviceInformationResponse> deviceInformation = apiContext.GetDeviceInformation();\r\n\r\n                    //output device information\r\n                    foreach (Xgminer.Api.Responses.DeviceInformationResponse item in deviceInformation)\r\n                        Console.WriteLine(\"Hasrate for device {0}: {1} current, {2} average\", item.Index,\r\n                                item.CurrentHashrate, item.AverageHashrate);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            finally\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Quitting mining via the RPC API\");\r\n\r\n                //stop mining, try the API first\r\n                apiContext.QuitMining();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        finally\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Killing any remaining process\");\r\n\r\n            //then kill the process\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                minerProcess.Kill();\r\n                minerProcess.WaitForExit();\r\n                minerProcess.Close();\r\n            }\r\n            catch (InvalidOperationException ex)\r\n            {\r\n                //already closed\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"No devices capable of mining detected\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfinally\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Cleaning up, deleting directory {0}\", executablePath);\r\n    Directory.Delete(executablePath, true);\r\n}\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit\");\r\nConsole.ReadKey();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHardware Donations\r\n-----------------\r\nTo those who may be considering making donations: instead of BTC or LTC I'd very much welcome __any sort of mining hardware__. I'm not talking nasty rigs and I absolutely __do not__ expect this. However, several bugs submitted by users have been due to hardware setups that I could not reproduce myself, such as FPGAs or having 10 devices in a single rig.\r\n\r\nSo if you are thinking of donating but also have some old FPGA that isn't doing much for you with the current Bitcoin difficulty, or some Erupters, or really anything at all that would help me test different hardware setups that would rock. It's _way_ easier to fix issues when I can actually reproduce them myself so this is a _very_ good way to give back.\r\n\r\nAgain this __not__ expected at all. The best thing you can do is let me know the details of any errors you have so I can fix them for everyone.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Nathanial Woolls\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
